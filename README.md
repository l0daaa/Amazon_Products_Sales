# üìí Amazon Products Sales Dataset ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **`EDA.ipynb`**, which performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the [Amazon Products Sales Dataset (2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikramshah512/amazon-products-sales-dataset-42k-items-2025).  

The notebook focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing product-level data to uncover insights into **pricing, discounts, customer ratings, reviews, and sales performance**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
The notebook is implemented in **Python 3** using the following libraries:
- **pandas** ‚Äì data manipulation and cleaning  
- **numpy** ‚Äì numerical operations  
- **matplotlib & seaborn** ‚Äì data visualization  
- **missingno** ‚Äì missing data visualization  

---

## üìÇ File Description
- **EDA.ipynb** ‚Üí Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis process.

---

## üîç Notebook Workflow
The notebook is structured into the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries & Load Data**  
   - Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
   - Initial exploration (shape, info, sample view)  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Convert text columns (`rating`, `number_of_reviews`, `bought_in_last_month`) into numeric  
   - Drop irrelevant columns (URLs, images, badges, etc.)  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - `discount_percentage` (relative discount)  
   - `price_difference` (absolute price gap)  
   - `is_high_rating` (flag for rating > 4)  
   - `is_discounted` (boolean for discounts)  
   - `price_category` (low / medium / high price bins)  
   - `product_category` (derived from product names using keyword mapping)  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Univariate Analysis**: product categories, ratings, prices, discount percentages  
   - **Bivariate Analysis**:  
     - Ratings vs. Reviews  
     - Price Category vs. Sales  
     - Discount Percentage vs. Sales  
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: overview of numeric relationships  

5. **Key Insights** (documented inline within the notebook)
